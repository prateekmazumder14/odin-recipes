    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <h3>For the Dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Water (as needed, to form dough)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil (optional, for softer dough)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 medium potatoes, boiled and mashed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>1-2 green chilies, finely chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ginger, grated</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh coriander leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the dough, combine whole wheat flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Add water little by little and knead
            into a smooth, soft dough. Cover with a damp cloth and set aside for 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>For the filling, heat some oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter. If using
            onions, add them and sauté until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add chopped green chilies and grated ginger. Sauté for a minute.</li>
        <li>Now add the boiled and mashed potatoes to the pan. Add garam masala, red chili powder, turmeric, and salt.
            Stir well to combine.</li>
        <li>Cook the mixture for 3-4 minutes, and then remove it from heat. Add fresh coriander leaves and lemon juice
            (optional). Let it cool.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has rested, divide it into equal-sized balls. Take one ball of dough and roll it into a small
            disc using a rolling pin.</li>
        <li>Place a spoonful of the prepared potato filling in the center of the disc. Bring the edges together to seal
            the filling inside, forming a ball again.</li>
        <li>Gently roll out the stuffed dough ball into a flat, round paratha, being careful not to let the filling
            escape.</li>
        <li>Heat a tawa or griddle over medium-high heat. Place the rolled-out paratha on the hot tawa and cook for 1-2
            minutes until small bubbles form.</li>
        <li>Flip the paratha, and then apply some oil or ghee on the cooked side. Flip again and apply oil or ghee on
            the other side. Cook until both sides are golden and crispy.</li>
        <li>Remove the paratha from the tawa and serve hot with yogurt, pickle, or chutney.</li>
    </ol>
