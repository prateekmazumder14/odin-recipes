    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
        <li>500 grams chicken (or mutton, beef, or vegetables)</li>
        <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup yogurt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons biryani masala powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
        <li>Whole spices (1 bay leaf, 4-5 cloves, 2-3 cardamom pods, 1 cinnamon stick)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh coriander leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup mint leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>4 cups water (for cooking rice)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and soak the basmati rice in water for about 30 minutes. Drain the water before cooking.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, bring water to a boil, add salt and the soaked rice. Cook the rice until it's about 70-80%
            done, then drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In another large pot or pan, heat oil and ghee. Add the whole spices (bay leaf, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon).
            Fry them until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add sliced onions to the pot and fry them until they turn golden brown. Set half of the fried onions aside
            for garnishing.</li>
        <li>Add ginger-garlic paste and saut√© for 1-2 minutes until the raw smell disappears.</li>
        <li>Add chopped tomatoes, biryani masala, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Cook until the tomatoes
            soften and the oil begins to separate.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken (or choice of meat/vegetables) and cook until it is browned and cooked through. Add yogurt
            and mix well, simmer for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Now, layer the partially cooked rice over the meat mixture. Sprinkle chopped mint and coriander leaves on
            top, followed by the fried onions you set aside earlier.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot with a tight lid. Cook on low heat for 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and rice to
            finish cooking (you can also place a heavy pan under the pot to prevent burning).</li>
        <li>Once done, remove from heat and let it rest for 5 minutes before serving. Serve hot with raita or a salad of
            your choice!</li>
    </ol>
